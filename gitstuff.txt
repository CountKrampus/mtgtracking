● Done. Here's what was created and how the workflow works:

  New files:
  - .gitignore — protects user data (.env, cached-images/, node_modules/)
  - update.sh — Linux/Mac update script
  - update.bat — Windows update script

  What the update scripts do:
  1. Check git is installed and the repo is set up
  2. Stash any local changes the user made
  3. git pull --rebase from GitHub
  4. Restore stashed changes (warns on merge conflicts)
  5. npm install in backend/, frontend/, and root (picks up new packages)
  6. chmod +x on scripts (Linux only)
  7. Show a summary of what changed (commit log)

  One-time setup you need to do:
  cd /home/boo/mtg-tracker
  git init
  git add -A
  git commit -m "Initial commit"
  # Create a repo on GitHub, then:
  git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USER/mtg-tracker.git
  git push -u origin main

  Your friends' first-time setup:
  git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USER/mtg-tracker.git
  cd mtg-tracker
  ./install-linux.sh        # or manual npm install
  cp backend/.env.local backend/.env

  Updating (what your friends run):
  ./update.sh               # Linux/Mac
  update.bat                # Windows

  Their .env, cached-images/, and database are never touched by updates since .gitignore keeps those out of git entirely.
