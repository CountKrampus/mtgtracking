# Collection Management Ideas

## High Priority

### Advanced Search & Filtering
- **Saved Filters / Filter Presets**: Save commonly used filter combinations (e.g., "Trade Binder NM Rares") and load them with one click
- **Multi-Select Filters**: Allow selecting multiple colors, types, sets, or conditions at once (e.g., show Red AND Blue cards)
- **Price Range Filter**: Slider or min/max input to filter cards by price (e.g., $1–$5, $20+)
- **Date Added Filter**: Filter cards by when they were added to the collection (last 7 days, last month, custom range)
- **Mana Cost / CMC Filter**: Filter by converted mana cost range (0–1, 2–3, 4–5, 6+)
- **Negative Filters / Exclude**: Ability to exclude specific sets, colors, or types from results
- **Full-Text Oracle Search Improvements**: Search for specific keywords in oracle text with AND/OR operators (e.g., "draw AND discard")
- **Regex Search**: Power-user option to search card names or oracle text with regex patterns

### Card Entry & Editing
- **Batch Edit Mode**: Inline editing of multiple cards at once in a spreadsheet-like view (edit price, condition, quantity directly in the table)
- **Quick Add Bar**: Persistent card entry bar at the top of the page — type name, hit Enter, card added instantly with defaults
- **Duplicate Detection Improvements**: Warn when adding a card that exists in a different set, offer to merge or keep separate
- **Card Condition Photos**: Attach photos to cards to document actual condition (scratches, whitening, etc.)
- **Purchase History**: Track when and where each card was purchased, and at what price
- **Custom Fields**: Let users define their own metadata fields (e.g., "Signed", "Artist Proof", "Altered")

### Organization
- **Sub-Collections**: Create named sub-collections within the main collection (e.g., "Trade Binder", "EDH Staples", "Bulk")
- **Card Grading Integration**: Track PSA/BGS/CGC grades for graded cards with special display
- **Card Notes**: Per-card notes field for personal annotations ("Borrowed from Dave", "Reserved for deck X")
- **Drag-and-Drop Sorting**: Manual drag-and-drop ordering within filtered views
- **Card Grouping**: Group cards by set, color, type, or custom criteria with collapsible sections

## Medium Priority

### Collection Insights
- **Recently Added**: Section showing the last 10-20 cards added
- **Recently Updated**: Track which cards had price changes or edits recently
- **Collection Timeline**: Visual timeline of when cards were added over weeks/months
- **Duplicates Finder**: View showing all cards you own more than a playsets worth of (5+ copies)
- **Missing Playsets**: Show cards where you have 1-3 copies — useful for knowing what to pick up
- **Value Over Time Chart**: Graph showing total collection value over time (requires periodic snapshots)
- **Price Alerts**: Set alerts for when a card's price drops below or rises above a threshold

### Card Display
- **Grid/Gallery View**: Toggle between table view and visual grid of card images (like a binder page)
- **Card Detail Modal**: Click a card to see full details, image, price history, oracle text, rulings in a modal
- **Sort by Color Identity**: Sort using WUBRG order rather than alphabetical
- **Visual Mana Cost Display**: Render mana symbols as colored circles instead of text ({W}{U} → actual mana symbols)
- **Card Back Display**: Show both faces of double-faced cards with a flip animation
- **Foil Shimmer Effect**: Visual shimmer/holographic effect on foil card images in gallery view

## Lower Priority

- **Collection Comparison**: Compare your collection with a friend's to find trade opportunities
- **Barcode/UPC Scanning**: Scan sealed product barcodes to auto-add all cards from a set
- **Random Card Button**: "Show me a random card from my collection" for fun discovery
- **Card of the Day**: Highlight a random card from your collection each day on the dashboard
- **Collection Milestones**: Achievements like "100 cards!", "First Mythic!", "$1000 collection value!"
- **Flavor Text Search**: Search specifically within card flavor text
- **Artist Filter**: Filter cards by artist name
- **Card Language Tracking**: Track what language each card is in (English, Japanese, etc.)
- **Alternate Art Tracking**: Distinguish between regular art, extended art, borderless, showcase, etc.
- **Card Version Selector**: When adding a card, show all available printings with art previews to pick the exact version
